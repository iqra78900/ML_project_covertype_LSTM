# Getting Started

Access the notebook via browser:
https://github.com/iqra78900/ML_project_covertype_LSTM/blob/main/ML_project_LSTM.ipynb

# Running the Code

1. Either:
   - Direct link to notebook: https://github.com/iqra78900/ML_project_covertype_LSTM/raw/main/ML_project_LSTM.ipynb
   - Or visit the repository page: https://github.com/iqra78900/ML_project_covertype_LSTM

2. Ensure all the following packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow sklearn matplotlib pandas numpy xgboost seaborn

3. Model was seeded with random_state=42. Use this value to reproduce results.

4. Run cells one by one. To run the "Development of LSTM model" cell around 5 minutes is needed
